# Fruster Scripts

This repo contains scripts for:

* Create a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS
* Installing tools and software onto the cluster:
	* Helm
	* Deis
	* NATS

The goal is to, instead of documentation, provide an automatated way of creating a production grade
environment following best practises learnt during the last two years of working with Fruster.

Scripts are interactive when needed to but aims to have sensible defaults to make 
installation at smooth as possible. 

## Installation

```
sudo curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrostDigital/fruster-scripts/master/install/fruster-install.sh | sudo bash
```

> NOTE: As a precaution and good practise, please verify that the install script looks ok as this is invoked as sudo (we are not evil).
